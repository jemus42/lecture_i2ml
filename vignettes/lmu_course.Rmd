## General information

This course is partly an online course, partly a 5-day course at LMU.

The target audience is statistics and data science students.
We also welcome students from computer science or any other institute or faculty, 
as long as we have enough space. 



### Flipped classroom block course

The active part - solving exercises, discussing material - will happen during the in-person classes, while the passive part - watching course videos, reading material - will happen on your own time and at a place of your choice. 

**It is extremely important that you watch the videos and try to understand the course material before we meet for class!** 
The exercises, code demos and activities that we will work on together during the in-person classes all depend on the knowledge you gain by working on the course materials *in advance*. This is not a passive, lecture-type course -- you need to be active yourself and prepare each day in a self-directed fashion like the responsible adult that you are.


### Moodle

All course specific information is available on [Moodle](https://moodle.lmu.de/course/view.php?id=4392).
You HAVE to enroll in moodle and you will HAVE to register for the exam there.
We will use Moodle to communicate with you.
