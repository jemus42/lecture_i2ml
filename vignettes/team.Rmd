- [Bernd Bischl](https://www.compstat.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/people/bischl/) 
  wrote the initial version of most of the course material, and teaches various master courses in ML and DL at the LMU for stats and data science.
- [Fabian Scheipl](https://www.biostat.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/personen/mitarbeiter/scheipl/index.html) 
  contributed (marginally) to the slides and quizzes and was asked to participate primarily because of his good looks and his funny Bavarian-English. 
  Bernd says: Fabian is a great teacher, and was the first to provide video-based course content for his amazing course on advanced R programming at the LMU. As he is also an expert in predictive modelling. I am extremly happy that he joined the team in fall 2018.
- [Heidi Seibold](https://www.compstat.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/people/seibold) joined the team in fall 2019 and is in charge of the classes held in spring 2020 at LMU Munich and University of Bielefeld.
- [Daniel Schalk](https://www.compstat.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/people/schalk) 
  is a PhD at Bernd's group and organized the second round of the inverted classroom in spring 2019; he also provided the digital platform for videos, quizzes and exercises. 
- [Christoph Molnar](https://www.compstat.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/people/molnar)
