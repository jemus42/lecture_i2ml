# Welcome

- Honored to work with you!
- Teaching this course for the first time. Feedback very welcome.
- Hope to create an environment that allows learning. 
	- No judgement 
	- Questions are highly appreciated
	- I am here to help you learn, not to show you how smart I am
	- I often find it easier to ask a peer first, which is why we will do a
	  lot of group work. 
	- If you have quesions and I am not available, write them down and ask
	  me later!
	- Feel free to add any questions to Etherpad
