* Many concepts in ML can explained without referring to the inner workings of a certain algorithm or
  model, especially things like model evaluation and tuning.
* ML also nowadays consists of dozens (or hundreds?) of different modelling techniques, where
  it is quite unclear which of these are really needed (outside of pure research) and which are
  really best.
* Understanding model-agnostic techniques is really paramount and
  can be achieved in a limited amount of time.

## ML as Black-Box Modeling


* Really studying the inner workings of each and every ML model can take years. Do we even need to
  do this at all for some models?
  + No: They exist in software. We can simply try them out, in the best case with an intelligent
    program that iterates over them and optimizes them.
  + Yes: At least some basic knowledge helps to make right choices. Actually knowing what you are
    doing is always good, also outside of science. And often stuff goes wrong,
    then understanding helps, too.

## ML as Black-Box Modeling

* In the follwoing slides we will go through really fundamental terms and concepts in ML,
  that are relevant for everything that comes next.

* We will also learn a couple of extremely simple models to obtain a basic understanding.

* More complex stuff comes later.

## ML as Black-Box Modeling

Imagine you want to investigate how salary and workplace conditions effect
productivity of employees.
Therefore, you collect data about worked minutes per week (productivity),
how many persons work at the same office of the employee and his salary.

<!-- Whats the problem:

- Specific question we want to answer.
- We (hopefully) have data which might be helpful for answering the question.
- But: how can we answer the question adequate using these data?

*"... Machine learning algorithms can figure out how to perform important tasks by generalizing from examples."*

\hfill \textit{Pedro Domingos}

## Question and Corresponding Data

Think about any question which comes to your mind, e.g. how to determine the productivity of an employee, and lets decompose that question:

1.  How can we measure productivity (our **target**)?  \
    $\rightarrow$ The number of worked minutes per week of the employee.
1.  What might influence productivity and how can we measure those **features** (do we already have data)?  \
    $\rightarrow$ How many people are in the same office and the salary of the employee.
1.  If there is a relationship between features and target, how can we get a (good) representation (**model**)? \
    $\rightarrow$ We will use machine learning for that. -->

<!-- ## Target and Features

If we collect data we have to represent them mathematically:

- **Target Variable:** $y$ representing worked minutes per week.
- **Features:** $x = (x_1, x_2)$ with:
    - $x_1$ Number of people in one office
    - $x_2$ Salary in euro

At this point we does not have collected any data, we have just defined how to represent them. -->

## Data, Target and Features

<!-- After collecting data, we can think of it as a table with $n = 3$ rows and $3$ columns consisting of $p = 2$ features and one target variable: -->

```{r, fig.align="center", out.width="0.8\\textwidth", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(ap("figure/data_table.png"))
```

\vspace{-0.5cm}

The whole data set is expressed by
\[
\D = \Dset
\]
with the $i$-th observation $\xyi$.

## Target and Features Relationship

- For our observed data we know which outcome is produced:

\vspace{-0.5cm}

```{r, fig.align="center", out.width="0.9\\textwidth", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(ap("figure/new_data0_web.png"))
```

## Target and Features Relationship

- For new employees we can just observe the features:

\vspace{-0.5cm}

```{r, fig.align="center", out.width="0.9\\textwidth", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(ap("figure/new_data1_web.png"))
```

\vspace{-0.5cm}

$\Rightarrow$ The goal is to predict the target variable for **unseen new data** by using a **model** trained on the already seen **train data**.

## Supervised Learning Task

- **Regression task** if we have to predict a numeric target variable,
  e.g., the minutes an employee works per week.
- **Classification task** if we have to predict a categorical target state,
  e.g., if an employee is happy with his job or not.
