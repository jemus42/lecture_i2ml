## Summary

- Minimizing the *within-cluster variation* exactly is not feasible and can be approximated by the $K$-means algorithm.

- $K$-means always converges, however, the cluster assignments strongly depend on the initial
  centers. \
  $\rightarrow$ repeat it several times with different initial centers.

- A simple solution for choosing the number of clusters $K$ is to plot the
  *within-cluster variation* for several $K$ and look for an *"elbow"* which is a good guess for $K$.
  
<!-- - Without the knowledge of the real groups, one can use *indices*, which combine *compactness* and *separation* measures, to validate the clustering assignments. -->
