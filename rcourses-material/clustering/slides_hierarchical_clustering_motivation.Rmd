## Motivation for Clustering

Consider multivariate data with $N$ observations (e.g. customers) and $P$ 
features (e.g. characteristics of customers).

Task: divide data into groups (clusters), such that 

- the observations in each cluster are as "similar" as possible (homogeneity 
  within each cluster), and

- the clusters are as "far away" as possible from other clusters (heterogeneity 
  between different clusters).

## Clustering vs. Classification

- In classification, the groups are known and we try to learn what 
  differentiates these groups (i.e., learn a classification function) to 
  properly classify future data.

- In clustering, we look at data, where groups are unknown and try to find 
  similar groups.

Why do we need clustering?

- Discovery: looking for new insights in the data (e.g. finding groups of customers that buy a similar product).

- Derive a reduced representation of the full data set.
