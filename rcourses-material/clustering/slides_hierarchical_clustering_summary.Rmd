## Summary

- *Hierarchical agglomerative clustering methods* iteratively merge observations/clusters until all observations are in one single cluster.

- Results in a hierarchy of clustering assignments which can be visualized in a *dendrogram*. 
Each node of the dendrogram represents a cluster and its `height' is proportional to the distance of its child nodes.

- The most common linkage functions are *single, complete*, *average* and *centroid* linkage. 
There is no perfect linkage and each linkage has its own advantages and disadvantages.
