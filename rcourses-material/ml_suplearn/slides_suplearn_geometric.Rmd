## Supervised: Geometric Approach

Idea: Relate outputs of observations $x$ and $\tilde{x}$ to each other,
if their distance in input space is not large.

E.g.: $\tilde{x}$ should have the same label as $x$, as the feature values
of $\tilde{x}$ are nearly the same as the values of $x$, i.e. $d(x, \tilde{x})$ is small.

Popular distance for numerical data: \textbf{Euclidean distance}
    \begin{equation*}
      d_{\text{Euclidean}}\left(x, \tilde{x}\right) = \sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^p(x_j- \tilde{x}_j)^2}
    \end{equation*}

It is based on a special case of the $L_q$-norm: $||x||_q = (|x_1|^q + ... + |x_q|^q)^\frac{1}{p}$ with $q = 2$.
