## Classification: Generative Approach

The \emph{generative approach} estimates the posterior probability of each class by
using the Bayes theorem:
\[
\pikx = \postk = \frac{\P\left(x \mid y = k\right) \P\left(y = k\right)}{\P\left(x\right)} \propto \pdfxyk \pik
\]
and we model $\pdfxyk$ -- usually by making a parametric assumption.

Discriminant function are now $\pikx$ or $\lpdfxyk + \lpik$.
