## Classification Task: Posterior Probabilities

- Often estimating class probabilities for observations is more
  informative than predicting labels.
- Posterior probabilities are the probability of a class $k$ occuring, given the feature $x$
\[
\pikx = P(Y = k | x)
\]
- Many models can directly output and optimize for these probabilities.

- Class estimation for $x$ via $\argmax_{k} \pikx$ - just take most likely class.

- We will talk much more about this in ROC analysis.


## Classification Task: Decision Boundary

- Area in feature space where there is no unique best class with maximum posterior probability are equal,
  e.g., for binary classification $\pix_1 = \pix_2$
- Separates areas in which a specific class is estimated / chosen.
