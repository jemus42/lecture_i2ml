## Course overview

The module offers an introductory and applied overview of ML regression and classification. 
This includes models such as linear regression, discriminant analysis, naive Bayes, decision trees and random forests, and their evaluation, with cross-validation and ROC analysis. 
At the end, we will briefly discuss and summarize more advanced techniques like hyperparameter optimization, model selection, nested resampling,and give some advice regarding practical work. 
The course is of an introductory nature and geared towards Bachelor's students.
It aims at a practical and operational understanding of the covered algorithms and models, with less emphasis on theory and formalism.
The accompanying exercises and tutorials are a mix of theoretical and practical assignments, the latter in `R`.

## Concept

The course is organized as a digital lecture, which should be as self-contained and enable self-study as much as possible. 
The major part of the material is provides as slide sets with lecture videos.
We have also prepared interactive tutorials where you can answer multiple choice questions, and learn how to apply the covered methods in `R` on some very short coding exercises. 
Our plan is to extend this practical self-study material over the next months and years.

## Requirements

- The course is targeted at *ML beginners* with a basic, university level, education in maths
- Simple linear algebra
- Simple calculus
- Simple probability theory
- Some stats knowledge, you should now what a mean, variance, bias, etc., is
- (Linear) Modelling from a stats perspective can help, but is not required, we sometimes compare to that
- Working knowledge of R
