In this course, you will learn the fundamental techniques and concepts of supervised Machine Learning, which has become a central part of modern data analysis. In particular, non-linear and non-parametric methods have been used successfully in uncovering complex patterns and relationships by computer scientists and statisticians.

The module offers an introductory and applied overview of supervised learning methods and concepts for regression and classification. This includes models such as linear regression, discriminant analysis, naive Bayes, decision trees and random forests, but also more advanced techniques like model selection, feature selection, and hyperparameter optimization. The focus of the course is to give a basic understanding of the different algorithms, models and concepts while explaining the necessary mathematical foundation.

As an active participant, you'll acquire theoretical as well as practical competencies regarding some of the most important machine learning models. Additionally, you will start to learn how to conduct a data analysis project yourself, including understanding and interpreting the data, in order to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the different methods. The accompanying exercise classes are a mix of theoretical and practical assignments. The latter will be conducted in `R` and will cover all methods introduced during the lecture.

## Concept

The course is organized in the flipped classroom format: The active part (solving exercises, discussing material, ...) will happen in the course, while the passive part (watching course videos, reading material) will happen outside of the course (at home / at your favorite caf√© / ...). 

**It is extremely important that you watch and try to understand all of the course videos and work on the tutorials before we meet for class!** The exercises, code demos and activities we will do together in the course all depend on the knowledge you gain by working on the course materials *in advance*. This is not a passive, lecture-type course -- you need to be active yourself and prepare each day in a self-directed fashion like the responsible adult that you are.

To help you with this, we have prepared interactive **tutorials** where you can watch the videos, answer multiple choice questions, and learn how to apply the theory using `R` on some very short coding exercises -- you can find them under the "Tutorials" tab at the top of the page and in the links below.
