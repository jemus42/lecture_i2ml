         Made using pdflatex, Beamer and Tikz. 
         Three sources files:

         * race-styles.tex: Common settings. You need to \input this
           file before the other two. The other two files can be used
           independently. See aco-beam-search-tree.tex for an example
           on how to use them.
         * race.tex: Main animation.
         * race-test.tex: Example text.
