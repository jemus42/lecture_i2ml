Take a look at the Ionosphere dataset from the \texttt{mlbench} package and descripe the dataset shortly. You don't have to summarize all its statistical properties but rather what kind of classification problem it is. Which classifiers from the lecture seem to be applicable for the dataset? Descripe independently of your code how you proceeded to in your analysis and what your results are.\\
\textbf{Note:} You don't have to check every single classifier in every configuration, more importantly is a smart approach with moderate effort. Use \texttt{mlr} for your analysis.
