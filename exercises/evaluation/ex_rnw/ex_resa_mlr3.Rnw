\begin{enumerate}[a)]
  \item Why would we apply resampling rather than a single holdout split?
  \item Using \texttt{mlr3}, classify the \texttt{german\_credit} data into 
  solvent and insolvent debtors using
  logistic regression. Compute the training error w.r.t. MCE.
  \item In order to evaluate your learner, compare test MCE using
  \begin{enumerate}[i)]
    \item three times ten-fold cross validation (3x10-CV)
    \item 10x3-CV
    \item 3x10-CV with stratification for the feature \texttt{foreign\_worker} 
    to ensure equal representation in all folds
    \item a single holdout split with 90\% training data
  \end{enumerate}
  (Hint: you will need \texttt{rsmp}, \texttt{resample} and \texttt{aggregate}.)
  \item Discuss and compare your findings from c) and compare them to the 
  training error from b).
  \item Would you consider LOO-CV to be a good alternative?
\end{enumerate}
