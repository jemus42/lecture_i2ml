We consider the \texttt{BostonHousing} data for which we would like to predict
the nitric oxides concentration (\texttt{nox}) from the distance to a number of 
firms (\texttt{dis}).

  \item Use the first ten observations as training data to compute a linear 
  model with \texttt{mlr3} and evaluate the performance of your learner on the 
  remaining data using MSE.
  
  \item What might be disadvantageous about the train-test split in a)?
  
  \item Now, sample your training observations from the data set at random. 
  Use a share of 0.1 through 0.9, in 0.1 steps, of observations for training 
  and repeat this procedure ten times.
  Afterwards, plot the resulting test errors (in terms of MSE) in a suitable 
  manner. \\
  (Hint: \texttt{rsmp} is a convenient function for splitting data -- 
  you will want to choose the "holdout" strategy. Afterwards, \texttt{resample}
  can be used to repeatedly fit the learner.)
  
  \item Interpret the findings from c).
  
  % \item After this empirical experiment we take a look at the mathematical 
  % background of the bias-variance trade-off in choosing the split ratio 
  % (with no specific assumption about the kind of learner used).
  % First, consider the expected quadratic error between predictions 
  % $\hat y$ and target values $y(\xv)$:
  % $$\Exy ((\hat y - y)^2 ~|~ \xv)$$
  % and show that
  % $$\Exy ((\hat y - y(\xv))^2) = \left(\hat y - \Exy(y(\xv)) 
  % \right)^2 + \var_{xy}(y(\xv)).$$
  % 
  % \item We then go one step further, assuming repeated estimations of the 
  % generalization error (e.g., through repeated holdout splitting), and treat our 
  % prediction $\hat y$ as a 
  % random variable.
  % Usually, predictions are deterministic once we have found a model by empirical 
  % risk minimization, but now our model is itself not fixed because the training 
  % data are a random sample from the data-generating process $\Pxy$.
  % As we have seen in the experiments from exercise c), this results in 
  % a distribution of prediction values over the repetitions of our sampling 
  % procedure.
  % We therefore work with the expectation $\E_{\hat y}$ w.r.t. $\hat y$.
  % Building on the previous exercise, show that
  % $$\Exy (\E_{\hat y}((\hat y - y)^2) ~|~ \xv) =
  % \left(\E_{\hat y}(\hat y) - \Exy(y ~|~ \xv) \right)^2 +
  % \var_{\hat y}(\hat y) + \var_{xy}(y ~|~ \xv)$$
  % (note that the expectation $\E_{\hat y}$ must be placed on the outside of the 
  % quadratic expression because taking the square is not a linear transformation 
  % and, in general, $\E(a^2) \neq \E^2(a)$).
  % 
  % Identify the components that represent bias and error, respectively.
  % Can you imagine what the remaining term stands for?
