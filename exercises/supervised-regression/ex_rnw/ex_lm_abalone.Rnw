We want to predict the age of an abalone using its longest shell measurement and 
its weight.

See \url{https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/abalone/} for more details.

\begin{itemize}
  \item[a)] Plot \texttt{LongestShell} and \texttt{WholeWeight} on the $x$- 
  and $y$-axis, respectively, and color points according to \texttt{Rings}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item[b)] \texttt{R}: Create an \texttt{mlr3} task for the \texttt{abalone} data. Define a linear regression learner (for this you will need to load 
  the \texttt{mlr3learners} extension package first) and use it to train a 
  linear model on the \texttt{abalone} data.\\
  \texttt{Python}: Initiate a linear regression learner (for this you will need to import the \texttt{from sklearn.linear\_model import LinearRegression} extension package first) and use it to train a 
  linear model on the \texttt{abalone} data. 
  \item[c)] Compare the fitted and observed targets visually. \\
   (\texttt{R} Hint: use \texttt{autoplot()}.)\\
  (\texttt{Python} Hint: use \texttt{import matplotlib.pyplot as plt}.)
  \item[d)] Assess the model's training loss in terms of MAE. \\
    (\texttt{R} Hint: losses are retrieved by calling \texttt{\$score()}, which accepts 
  different \texttt{mlr\_measures}, on the \\ prediction object.)\\
  (\texttt{Python} Hint: The MAE metric is retrieved by calling \texttt{from sklearn.metrics import mean\_absolute\_error}.)
