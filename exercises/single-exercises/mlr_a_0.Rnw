Read the tutorial of the \texttt{mlr} package at http://mlr-org.github.io/mlr-tutorial.
Make sure that you start from the quick start example in "Home" then go through each chapter in "Basics".
\begin{enumerate}
<<<<<<< HEAD
  \item Try out the demo codes in the tutorial and try to understand what is the concept of Task and Learner. Try out the examples in the tutorial to learn to use the function \texttt{mlr::train}, \texttt{mlr::predict} and \texttt{mlr::performance}
  \item How many measures you already know? Try to explain some of them. For example, you could list the measures for classification by \texttt{mlr::listMeasures("classif", properties = "classif")}
\item Use the BostonHousing dataset(actually there is a built in task in mlr called bh.task which you could directly use) as an example, split the dataset into train and test by specifying index vectors to the parameter "subset" in function \texttt{mlr::train} and \texttt{mlr::predict}, keep the train and test split portion to be equal size.
\item Change the train and test split by specifying different index vectors, what effects will it have do you think by using different train and test split? Implement this in code and prove your idea.
\item What arguments to you have to specify if you want the prediction output to be probabilities for a classification task?

\item Try out the demo codes in the tutorial and try to understand what the concept of Task and Learner is, and how to use the functions \texttt{train}, \texttt{predict} and \texttt{performance}.
\item How many performance measures you already know? Try to explain some of them. How can you see which measures are available in \texttt{mlr}?
\item Use the \texttt{bh.task} regression task from \texttt{mlr} and split the data into $50\%$ training data and $50\%$ test data while training and predicting (i.e., use the \texttt{subset} argument of the \texttt{train} and \texttt{predict} function).
Fit a prediction model (e.g. CART) to the training set and make predictions for the test set.
\item Now use different observations (but still $50\%$ of them) for the training set. What effects does this have?
\item What do you have to do in \texttt{mlr} if you want the prediction output to be probabilities (and not classes)?
