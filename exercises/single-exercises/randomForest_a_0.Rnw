\begin{enumerate}
<<<<<<< HEAD
\item Take a look at the \texttt{spam} dataset from the package \texttt{ElemStatLearn}. Shortly describe what kind of classification problem this is.
\item Make a task of this problem using mlr.
\item Use a random forest to fit the model and plot the oob-error against the number of trees used. Hint: \texttt{makeLearner("classif.ranger")}
\item Your boss wants to have only have a small number of variables in the model and wants to know which variables have the biggest influence on the prediction quality. Explain your approach in words as well as code. Hint: use \texttt{getLearnerModel(your trained model)\$variable.importance}

\item Take a look at the \texttt{spam} dataset from the package \texttt{ElemStatLearn}.
Shortly describe what kind of classification problem this is and create a task for \texttt{mlr}.

\item Use a random forest to fit the model and plot the oob-error against the number of trees used.

Hint: You can use \texttt{getLearnerModel(model)}.

\item Your boss wants to know which variables have the biggest influence on the prediction quality. Explain your approach in words as well as code.

Hint: use \texttt{mlr::getFeatureImportance} and/or \texttt{randomForest::varImpPlot}.
