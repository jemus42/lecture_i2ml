Create a plot for the RBF-SVM which shows $C \times \gamma \longrightarrow \rho$, where $\rho$ is (a) the classification accuracy and (b) the runtime.
$C$ and $\gamma$ should be varied on a log2-scale from -15 to 15. Use 10-fold crossvalidation and the Ionosphere dataset. This can take some time, use parallelization.
