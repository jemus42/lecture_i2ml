\begin{enumerate}
\item Try to manually compute the first split point that the CART algorithm would do on the following dataset, once using x as feature and once using log(x) as feature:

\begin{center}
<<echo = FALSE>>=
x = c(1,2,7,10,20)
y = c(1,1,0.5,10,11)
data = t(data.frame(x = x, y = y))
kable(data)
@
<<<<<<< HEAD
and the log transform of it

<<echo = FALSE, fig.align='right'>>=
log.x = log(x)
data = t(data.frame(log.x, y))
rownames(data) = c("log(x)", "y")
kable(data,digits = 1)
@
\item Implement your own CART algorithm dealing with the above problem with a few lines of code
=======
\end{center}
\item Implement an R code that finds the best split point according to the CART algorithm (i.e., solve the exercise above in R).
