Simulate 500 samples from the \texttt{mlbench.spirals} data with a standard 
deviation of 0.1, and 4 cycles.

Visualize the decision boundaries of a random forest (\texttt{classif.ranger} 
learner from \texttt{mlr3learners}), using 
\texttt{mlr3viz::plot\_learner\_prediction}, for forest sizes $M \in 
(1, 2, 10, 100, 1000)$ trees.
Explain what you see.
