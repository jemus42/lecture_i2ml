Implement the MetaCost algorithm and use it with some classifier of your choice on an imbalanced data set of your choice, where the cost-matrix is given by the cost-sensitive heuristic we saw in the lecture. Compare the confusion matrices of the underlying classifier and the MetaCost classifier as well as their total costs.
