Generate an artificial dataset with the function call \texttt{mlbench.spirals(n = 500, sd = 0.1)}. (The function \texttt{mlbench.spirals} is part of the \texttt{mlbench} package.) Visualize the decision boundaries of a random forest using the \texttt{classif.ranger} learner from \texttt{mlr3learners}. Create plots with \texttt{plot\_learner\_prediction} from \texttt{mlr3viz} for an increasing number of trees. (Start with \texttt{num.trees = 1}) Explain what you see.
