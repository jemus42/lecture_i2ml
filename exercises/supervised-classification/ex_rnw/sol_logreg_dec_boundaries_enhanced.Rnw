\begin{enumerate}[a)]

  \item We evaluate
  \begin{flalign*}
    \hat{y} = 1 &\Leftrightarrow \pixh = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-\thetabh^\top \xv)} \geq
    \alpha \\
    &\Leftrightarrow\  1 + \exp(-\thetabh^\top \xv) \leq \frac{1}{\alpha} \\
    &\Leftrightarrow\ \exp(-\thetabh^\top \xv) \leq \frac{1}{\alpha}  - 1 \\
    &\Leftrightarrow\ -\thetabh^\top \xv \leq \log \left(\frac{1}{\alpha} - 1
    \right) \\
    &\Leftrightarrow\ \thetabh^\top \xv \geq -\log \left(\frac{1}{\alpha} - 1
  \right).
  \end{flalign*}
  $\thetabh^\top \xv = -\log \left(\frac{1}{\alpha} - 1 \right)$ is the equation
  of a linear
  hyperplane comprised of all linear combinations $\thetabh^\top \xv$ that are
  equal to
  $-\log \left(\frac{1}{\alpha} - 1\right)$.
  The inequality therefore describes the decision rule for setting
  $\hat y$ equal to 1 by taking all points that lie on or above this hyperplane.

  \item We observe
  \begin{itemize}
    \item in plot (1): the logistic function runs parallel to the $x_2$ axis,
    so it is the same for every value of $x_2$.
    In other words, $x_2$ does not contribute anything to the class
    discrimination and its associated
    parameter $\thetah_2$ is equal to 0.
    \item in plot (2): both dimensions affect the logistic function -- to equal
    degree in this case, meaning $x_1$ and $x_2$ are equally important.
    If $\thetah_1$ were larger than $\thetah_2$ or vice versa the hypersurface
    would be more tilted towards the respective axis.
    Furthermore, due to $\thetah_1$ and $\thetah_2$ being positive,
    $\pixh$ increases with higher values for $x_1$ and $x_2$.
    \item in plot (3): this is the same situation as in plot (2) but the
    logistic function is steeper, which is due to $\thetah_1, \thetah_2$ having
    larger absolute values.
    We therefore get a sharper separation between classes (fewer predicted
    probability values close to 0.5, so we are overall more confident in our
    decision).
    As in plot (2), the increasing probability of $\hat{y}=1$ for higher values of $x_1$
    and $x_2$ indicates positive values for $\thetah_1$ and $\thetah_2$.
    \item in plot (4): this is the same situation as in plot (1).
    The different values for $\alpha$ represent different thresholds: a
    high value (leftmost line) means we only assign class 1 if the estimated
    class-1 probability is large.
    Conversely, a low value (rightmost line) signifies we are ready to
    predict class 1 at a low threshold -- in effect, this is the same as
    the previous scenario, only the class labels are flipped.
    The mid line corresponds to the common case $\alpha = 0.5$ where we assign
    class 1 as soon as the predicted probability is more than 50\%.
  \end{itemize}

  \item We make use of our results from a):
  \begin{flalign*}
    \hat{y} = 1 &\Leftrightarrow \thetabh^\top \xv \geq -\log \left(\frac{1}{\alpha} - 1
  \right) \\
  &\Leftrightarrow \thetabh^\top \xv \geq -\log \left(\frac{1}{0.5} - 1
  \right) \\
  &\Leftrightarrow \thetabh^\top \xv \geq -\log 1 \\
  &\Leftrightarrow \thetabh^\top \xv \geq 0.
  \end{flalign*}
  The 0.5 threshold therefore leads to the coordinate hyperplane and divides
  the input space into the positive \enquote{1} halfspace where $\thetabh^\top \xv \geq 0$
  and the \enquote{0} halfspace where $\thetabh^\top \xv < 0$.

  \item When the threshold $\alpha = 0.5$ is chosen, the losses of
  misclassified observations, i.e., $L(\hat{y} = 0 ~|~ y = 1)$ and
  $L(\hat{y} = 1 ~|~ y = 0)$,
  are treated equally, which is often the intuitive thing to do.
  It means $\alpha = 0.5$ is a sensible threshold if we do not wish to avoid
  one type of misclassification more than the other.
  If, however, we need to be cautious to only predict class 1 if we are very
  confident (for example, when the decision triggers a costly therapy),
  it would make sense to set the threshold considerably higher.

\end{enumerate}
