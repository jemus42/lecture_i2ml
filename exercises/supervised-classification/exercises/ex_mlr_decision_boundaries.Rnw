Choose some of the classifiers already introduced in the lecture and visualize their decision boundaries for relevant hyperparameters.
Use \texttt{mlbench::mlbench.spirals} to generate data and use \texttt{plot\_learner\_prediction} for visualization. To refresh your knowledge about \texttt{mlr3} you can take a look at \url{https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com/basics.html}.
