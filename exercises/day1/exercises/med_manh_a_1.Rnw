Let $i = 1,\dots,n$ and $y^{(i)} \in \mathbb{R}$ be the ordered data of interest. Show that the median, which is then given by $$ y_{\text{med}} = \begin{cases}
\frac{y^{(\frac{n}{2})} +  y^{(\frac{n}{2} + 1 )}}{2},& \text{ if } n \text{ is even }  \\
 y^{(\frac{n+1}{2} )},& \text{ if } n \text{ is odd }
\end{cases}, $$ is the best constant model with L1 loss.
