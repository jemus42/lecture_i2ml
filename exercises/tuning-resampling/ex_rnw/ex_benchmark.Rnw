We want to conduct a small benchmark study:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Set up at least two datasets with a discrete target of your choice and save them in a list.
\item Set up at least three classifiers of your choice (that you are familiar with) and save them in a second list.
\item Create a resample description. Use an adequate method, depending on the size of your datasets and the complexity of the learners, so that the benchmark doesn't need hours to compute.
\item Run and visualize your benchmark study.
\end{enumerate}
